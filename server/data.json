Although while learning about web development I had built other applications, they were of a much smaller scope and were typically the result of following along with tutorials made to teach concepts like react itself. This website was made without the assistance of any guide or tutorial, and design decisions made are my own."

Content may overflow out of their containers and become unreadable, the top navbar may take up half the screen, and some content may just appear missing. To prevent these issues, I spent likely multiple hours in total with chrome's device toolbar open, fiddling with different sizes of devices while making small tweaks to ensure that everything worked exactly the way I wanted to.",
          "The most noticeable design decision is certainly the side nav bar that appears at screen sizes with low device widths. Although this component is always created regardless of device width, it only becomes available when needed, which helps to ensure it does not interfere with keyboard navigation. It can be opened using the button in the top navbar, and then closed by either removing focus from the navbar in any way, or pressing the escape key.",
          "In addition to the mobile view, there is also a layout change that occurs when there is no longer enough room for 2 side navbars but still enough room for one, which is referred to internally as tablet mode. Since all it does is reposition the “in this article” section, it is not the most groundbreaking change, but it does add a nice middle ground between mobile and monitor viewing.",

When tab is first pressed upon opening the page, a button is revealed that users can activate with the enter key to skip directly to the main content, allowing them to skip over the navigation links if they want.",
          "Additionally, regarding the mobile view's side navbar, focusing the element with the keyboard will automatically open the navbar, and removing focus will close it. Furthermore, although the mobile side nav bar is always created, I have ensured that it won't interfere with any sort of keyboard navigation or screen reading while not using a mobile view, therefore preventing the content inside from being accessed a second time."

Additionally, there are no places with text that should be small enough to strain the eye in any way.",
          "Also, you may have noticed the frequent use of css transitions throughout the website. This can be a nice visual effect, but sometimes motion like this can cause discomfort. Therefore, I configured the css in a way that ensures if it detects that a user prefers reduced motion, it disables transitions entirely."

When it leaves the visible area, it is set to false. Then, the first section in the map is sent to the table of contents component and the corresponding tag is given the “aria-current” value. From here, css is used to style the element using the [aria-current] attribute selector, and every anchor tag after it is given a different style than the default using the general sibling combinator, “~”, which matches every anchor tag that both descends from the same parent and comes after the a tag with the [aria-current] selector.",

Black and white definitely is not the most creative, and there isn't anything going on besides text and headings, but I think that is fine considering the scope of the project."
